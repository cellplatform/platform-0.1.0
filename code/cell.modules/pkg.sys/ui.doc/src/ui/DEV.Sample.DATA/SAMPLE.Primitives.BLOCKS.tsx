# Scale Matters

DAOs are extraordinary for their capacity to test experimental ideas. And the innovation DAOs are 
unlocking because of this, all across Web3, is astounding! But, in order to have a transformational 
impact on the world, we need DAOs to scale beyond experiments. There is a risk that if they can’t 
successfully scale what they do, their potentially transformational innovations will just get 
co-opted by more centralised organisations (pseudo-DAOs and companies), who can more effectively 
scale and exploit them. Leaving us in much the same position we are in now. 

Scale is not just about getting a lot of users onto a protocol with a bare bones interface that only 
early adopters will accept. In traditional startup speak, this would be considered validation or 
proof of concept only. Scale means delivering world class products to millions of people, with 
user experiences that are better than what Web2 is currently giving us.

I know we like to criticise the Web2 progenitors to our world, but these companies are running 
massively scaled operations the likes of which DAOs have not come close to yet.

It is true that digital scaling ([network effects](https://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-manual) + 
[scaling at near zero marginal cost](https://ckluis.com/the-marginal-cost-of-software-approaches-zero-7fda166f219f) + 
[moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law))
means that digital business models scale in particularly powerful ways. But this 
does not mean that these models scale effortlessly without needing infrastructure. The likes of 
Google, Meta, Twitter et al still have to design and build significant infrastructure to generate 
scale advantages for their business models across; design, software development, sales, marketing 
etc – just like any other business does. And likewise, DAOs don’t get to opt out of this dynamic 
just because they are digitally native.

It is also important to remember that DAOs are increasingly going to be building for real world 
applications. If Web3 is going to be a transformational force in the world, DAOs are going to 
need to operate across all of the domains that companies currently do. And for this to work, 
being able to harness scaling dynamics at least as well as companies currently do is going 
to be crucial.

Scale needs to be a clear part of DAO thinking going forward and we need to make sure that we 
aren’t ignoring it – consciously or unconsciously – just because it reminds us of traditional 
business. 

In the previous articles in this series – “[DAOs aren’t things… they are flows](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/3-ESNDLcf44dZ6VteaqZSpQuTL0oouSxlLJwuAlcQ_s)” 
and “[Scale and the levers that provide DAOs their power](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/unisNGUtHyRF7Zcp9CBbC-VhICOvVm0uzTFJUPX-Icg)” – 
we looked at how a legacy mindset causes us to think of DAOs as ‘entities’, but they are much better understood as networks with coordinated flows of resources and value. We then unpacked how biological systems, companies and cities all function based on two fundamental scaling dynamics:

We saw that unlike companies that operate business models, DAOs are network economies. 
This makes them more like cities, giving them the remarkable ability to leverage 
both **Dynamic One** and **Dynamic Two** scaling systems.

In this article we will dig deeper into how DAOs can deliberately design themselves to utilise 
both of these dynamics.

# From simple to massively complex

DAO structures need to start simply but then be able to grow into massive complexity. As DAOs try 
to scale, we cannot just apply arbitrary structure to them to solve the coordination issues that 
will naturally show up. If we do, we are just going to end up with broken systems. Ad hoc solutions 
that seem like good ideas at the time will end up causing problems like centralisation and 
fragility down the line in unexpected ways as they scale. 

[Galls Law](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:gall_s_law) reminds us that we need to start 
with simple systems that work:

SuperBenefitDAO recently hosted a [conversation on metagovernance](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/yyY2khsoDSgCBaLSIJMeT6xNPJ0c9d2T83rYyt6UfX8)
with \`Gabagool.eth\`, \`BPetes.eth\` and \`Justinehy.eth\`. As we explored the topic of metagovernance, 
one theme that came through strongly was the idea that we need to keep coming back to the 
magic that we all saw in DAOs in the first place. The magic of small groups of inspired 
people working together on something that matters to them – and the simple primitives 
that make this possible. From here we work our way up to complex governance and metagovernance, 
but we keep this simple starting point in focus. This is a great signpost for us to think about 
the simple primitives out of which complex DAO networks can emerge.  

DAOs as fractal networks of connected cells
When a core team of people come together to start a DAO, pretty quickly they feel the need to 
create sub-teams as a way of separating tasks and managing accountability. As soon as this 
happens, they have begun the complex and difficult journey of experimental org design. 

The mental model that rescues us from this becoming a morass of incoherent and unscalable 
structure is that of **fractal design**. Rather than umbrellaing these teams inside an entity 
(like a company does), we can think of these smaller teams as being identical in type to 
the DAO that birthed them. Each starts as a **DAO primitive**; a version of the DAO created 
out of itself, in order to get things done. All of these **DAO cells** exist in relationship 
with one another in a complex and emerging network. 

Call them “subDAOs, Pods, Fractals, Working Groups or Circles“ – I’ll refer to them as “cells” 
in this article because that works nicely with a biological metaphor, but the naming of them 
is neither here nor there – the mental model is to understand them as their own independent 
DAO cells that are defined by their relationships with other cells in the DAO network.

This notion of DAO cells as the primitive starting point for DAO networks is the basis for 
DAOs being able to leverage both of the scaling dynamics laid out in the [previous article](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/unisNGUtHyRF7Zcp9CBbC-VhICOvVm0uzTFJUPX-Icg).

It is also the mechanism by which DAO networks collectively evolve. 

---

Here is how both of these mechanisms work.


# Cells can become Scaling Hierarchies AND Creative Networks

When a new DAO cell is spun up in a DAO network, depending on the purpose it has, it needs to be 
set up to be either part of a scaling hierarchy or a creative network. 

**D1 Scaling Hierarchy:** If it is to play a role in a scaling hierarchy – for example, as part 
of DAO operations or core DAO infrastructure – then it will have quite tightly defined 
accountabilities. It will be closely coupled to other cells in the scaling hierarchy 
because its outputs will be critical to the functioning of the system as a whole. 

**D2 Creative Network:** However, if the cell came into existence to explore things like novel 
ideas, partnership opportunities or new areas of research, then it will be much less constrained. 

Where a cell needing to plug into a **scaling hierarchy** needs tight constraints to make sure that 
it is producing the outputs that the other cells in the hierarchy need, a **creative network** cell 
is set up to be maximally unconstrained. 

DAO cell primitives need to be easily configurable in order to dial up the right constraints 
to make them function as the DAO network needs. This requires clearly defining the 
accountabilities, roles and relationships with other cells in the network, and then 
setting up the corresponding governance structure and tooling to make this possible. 

Out of these single-celled starting points, DAOs then evolve into complex networks of cells.

# Example: DAO Prison Network

Let's make this more concrete by looking at a hypothetical example. Imagine a national prison 
system run as a DAO network. I’m choosing a difficult real-world problem here as an example 
to emphasise the challenges of scaling real-world systems.

The prison network is animated by its purpose of transforming how we approach crime as a 
social issue by searching for better solutions to these complex problems.

Because it is running existing infrastructure in an existing system, the DAO network would be 
made up in large part by **scaling hierarchies** consisting of networks of DAO cells that combine 
to deliver the well understood operational needs of the prison system. Things like buildings 
and facilities, security, health and welfare, education, staff/HR etc. These hierarchies of 
cells would be highly coordinated to deliver the right outputs, reliably and efficiently.     

Each DAO cell would be set up to perform a specific role in the system, be accountable to 
other cells that rely on it, and be governed to some extent by these interdependent cells. 
They would likely have ongoing streams of funding and would measure themselves by the 
effectiveness of their activities in delivering on the known outcomes they were created to 
produce. They would also have the ability to produce their own new DAO cells so that as their 
responsibilities grew they would be able to scale their activities via fractal hierarchical scaling.   

*An important caveat to add in case the word hierarchy is triggering. The term **scaling hierarchy** 
refers to the structure of a network that functions with this particular set of scale advantages. 
It doesn’t need to mean “dominator hierarchy” or “management hierarchy”. Companies traditionally 
use management hierarchies to implement a power structure, but DAOs don’t have to do this. 
Much of the cutting edge work in organisational design ([The Ready](https://theready.com/) being a great example), 
concerns itself with how we can coordinate at scale without resorting to old school management 
hierarchies, aka “command and control”. But make no mistake, DAOs do need to match their 
ability to innovate with a genuine ability to scale.*

But interspersed with these scaling hierarchies would be numerous loosely coupled **creative 
network** cells that are experimenting across the system in search of better solutions. 
Unlike the more highly coordinated scaling hierarchies which function with a well defined 
operating model and something that looks a lot like “strategy”, these creative cells will 
bubble up from ideas and inspiration from the DAO’s community. 

A member of the community can have a novel idea, refine it, get a proposal approved and then 
spin up a cell to start exploring it. For our prison example, things these cells might 
experiment on could look like:

1. Ideas for better systems for staff.  
   *Process Innovation/Horizon-1* (in traditional business speak)

2. Novel ideas for working with prisoners, rehabilitation etc.  
   *Product Line Expansion/Horizon-2*

3. Radical ideas that would make prisons as we know them obsolete.  
   *Disruptive Innovation/Horizon-3*

4. Ideas that bridge and extend the DAO network beyond prisons, perhaps into mental health or 
   early social crime prevention. Possibilities to connect and integrate the prison DAO into 
   larger aligned networks beyond prisons. 

These creative cells would be funded and structured to give them maximum freedom/autonomy. 
And then as creative cells evolve their ideas beyond experimentation, they can grow and connect 
with other parts of the larger DAO network to develop their discoveries into scaling hierarchies 
that the whole network can benefit from. 

# DAO networks evolve organically 

With traditional organisations and companies we are used to thinking about power structures. 
And so for an organisation to change, it requires the power structure to change at the highest 
level and then for this to cascade down through the hierarchy. However, because DAOs consist of 
networks of cells, they can evolve organically. 

For example, if a creative cell in our national prison DAO had been exploring an idea for early 
social intervention which prevented crime and discovered an exciting solution that would 
meaningfully reduce crime. That cell could generate its own contributors, community, token value, 
capital etc and as it grew would exert its own gravity on the larger DAO network. As this new 
opportunity started to scale it would change the shape of the original DAO as the network 
collectively reorientated itself around this new and impactful opportunity. Perhaps as a result 
the prison population would fall, but this is good news as the DAO would already have been flowing 
resources towards the new activities and possible new paradigm of transformational social outcomes.

This is sense-making in action. Rather than leaders in a power structure gathering up all the 
data and deciding on a new strategy for the DAO, the energy and resources flow with each 
individual member of the network as they gravitate towards the highest potential and most 
aligned opportunities. This is the DAO network reshaping itself organically using genuinely 
decentralised intelligence. Rather than trying to define and implement strategy for the DAO, 
strategy emerges **autonomously** from the DAO network itself.

This is in stark contrast to traditional organisations who can’t produce this kind of flexibility 
and collective intelligence due to rigid scaling infrastructure (see [previous article](https://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/unisNGUtHyRF7Zcp9CBbC-VhICOvVm0uzTFJUPX-Icg)). 
This legacy model leads to incredibly crappy externalities. This is easy to see in current 
private prison systems, where prison operators will often lobby governments for stricter 
enforcement of laws to increase prisoner numbers, in an attempt to maintain occupancy rates 
and ensure their business models keep working.

# Enough scale to pay for the innovation

These amazing network dynamics are great in theory but DAO networks need to generate enough 
scale to make them work in practice. Searching for novel solutions is resource intensive. 
If DAOs are going to be these combinations of scale and innovation that can sense and evolve, 
they need to be big enough to generate the scale efficiencies to afford to do it.

Scale is also needed to make sure that these valuable new ideas make it out into the world in 
a way that many people can benefit from them.

It is easy to see from our prisons example, that if the DAO network only included one prison, 
the system would likely not be able to sustain the kind of creative networks needed to actually 
find breakthrough solutions. And then if they did find a breakthrough solution, they would not 
have a network through which to scale it. In our previous article we talked about the city-like 
positive feedback mechanisms that DAOs can generate:

For all of this to work the DAO network needs to be operating at the scale of the system 
that it is trying to transform.

# DAOs as many interconnected networks working across vast scale

But all this talk of “enough scale”, must not collapse back into entity thinking. It is not 
about any one particular DAO being any particular size. This is the exciting opportunity. 
If we can pull the design of DAOs back to their smallest starting primitive cells, and DAOs 
(as networks of cells) just build up from there, then getting bogged down in where one DAO 
finishes and another starts becomes unnecessary. 

If one DAO cell can easily, and in a principled way, connect with any other DAO cell and form 
into a useful structure (scaling or creative), then in principle it should be just as easy for 
two cells in different DAO networks to connect as well. Given all the experimentation with 
things like token swaps and DAO-to-DAO tools, the technical and governance tooling to do this 
more and more easily is emerging.

In this way I don’t think the future will consist of giant monolithic DAOs that rival the likes 
of Google, Meta and other giant traditional companies. DAO networks present us with a different 
way of thinking about scale. A company needs to contain its hierarchical scaling dynamics inside 
an entity, but the tools that Web3 gives us allow the coordination of resources across and 
between vast networks.

So a Web3 solution that replaces Google might be a whole web of DAO networks that is spread 
across all of Google’s 4.3 billion users… some of whom are working in highly structured ways 
to deliver at-scale technical infrastructure and core functions, some who are working on 
thousands of smaller experimental projects that grow and evolve into new and valuable things, 
some who just use the products being created and contribute data to the network as a byproduct. 
Maybe there is one search product, maybe a hundred, maybe a million. 

I know developing a million products sounds implausible but there is no reason that the tools 
we are collectively evolving to coordinate shared ownership, governance and activity across 
interconnecting networks could not scale to coordinate a network of billions.


# DAOs are “network intelligence” that flows

DAO networks will find equilibrium as they scale and fill the needs/opportunities they are 
trying to fill. But they will constantly be evolving under the surface. Whether it is the 
culture of the network evolving within the larger cultures we inhabit; adapting to changing 
environments, developing new technical underpinnings or product/service offerings, harnessing 
emerging discoveries and innovation - they will be able to scale but also to evolve, grow and 
reorient towards what is needed. 

Unlike animals and companies who, because of their inflexibility, grow old and die, DAO networks 
will be like forests, dying and being reborn moment by moment as the energy and resources of the 
community flow, form, reform, connect and interconnect in ever more complex and useful ways.  

But DAOs developing into these kinds of complex emergent intelligent systems can’t happen in an 
ad hoc way, it has to be foundational. We need to focus on finding and refining the primitive 
starting points. We need to make sure that we are working towards simple systems that can evolve 
into vastly complex ones.

The limited liability company primitive was able to produce the vastly complex global systems 
we have today. Now we need DAO primitives that can similarly evolve into our next emerging paradigm.
